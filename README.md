- 👋 Hi, I’m @nataly-moreno
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, but when it comes to code, I'm interested in learning more about programming patterns and good software architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with everyone on anything that I can be helpful in.
- 📫 How to reach me... just message me.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Computer science found me; I did not even know about it. I used to think that my intro to programming classes were just classes where I got to play on the computer. It wasn't until a few months in that I realized I could major in it after talking to one of my first professors in office hours. Weirdly enough, when I was almost done with my degree I met up with an old friend from middle school and she said, "you always did say you were going make games".
